Note:
It still looks like there are a lot of commands to remember, but many of these commands perform similar functions.

---

- String

  - Setters

    - SET
      Used to set a string value to a key
      ex: SET message 'HI'

      - GET
        GET is an optional to the SET command => Get then update
        ex: SET message 'Hello' GET => returns the value of message then update it to 'Hello'
        if no previous value for the key message then it will return 'nil'

      - XX
        XX is an optional to the SET command => update if exist
        ex: SET message 'HEY' XX => if message is already exist, then it will update it
        else it will return 'nil'

      - NX
        NX is an optional to the SET command => set if not exist
        ex: SET message 'HEY' NX => if message is not already exist, then it will set it
        else it will return 'nil'

      - EX
        EX is an optional to the SET command => set for only a couple of seconds
        ex: SET message 'HEY' EX 5 => after 5 seconds delete this message key

    - SETRANGE
      Used for updating a portion of a string value.
      ex: SETRANGE message 3 'ASA'
      if message value was Hello it will be => 'HeASA'

    - There are more SET commands but not commonly used.

  - Getters

    - GET
      ex: GET name => Ahmed

    - GETRANGE
      Used for getting a portion of a string value.
      ex: GET data 0 2
      if data was 'ASA22' => it will return 'ASA'

---

- Number

  - INCR, DECR
    Used for incrementing or decrementing a value.
    ex: INCR age
    if age = 20 it will be 21

  - INCRBY, DECRBY
    Used for incrementing or decrementing a value.
    ex: INCRBY age 10
    if age = 20 it will be 31

  - INCRBYFLOAT
    Used for incrementing and decrementing a value by a float number.
    by using minus before the number it means decrease.
    ex: INCRBYFLOAT size -10.5
    if size = 25 it will be 14.5

  - So you may ask, 'Why do these number commands exist when I can retrieve and update this value on the server side and then save it back to the database?'
    The answer is, if we were to perform the update process on the server side, we would need to carry out two database operationsâ€”one for retrieving the data and another for setting it back.
    This would compromise the efficiency of using an in-memory database, which is all about speed.
    Also, updating values on the server side may lead to dealing with inconsistent values. This can occur when two requests for obtaining the same value happen simultaneously.
    In this case, both requests will read the same value. For instance, if both requests increase it by 1 and write it back, the data will have been increased by one when it should have been increased by two.

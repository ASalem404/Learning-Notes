# Notes Repository

Welcome to my Notes Repository! This repository is a collection of notes for various subjects, courses, and personal experiences. 
I'll be continuously updating it as I progress through new courses, review past subjects, or simply jot down my experiences and insights. 
Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore and use these notes for your own benefit.

- **Subjects in Progress:**
  - This section contains ongoing notes for subjects and courses that I'm currently studying. These notes may be incomplete,
    but I'll be updating them as I make progress.
    They reflect my current learning journey and serve as a dynamic resource for anyone interested in the topics I'm currently exploring.
  
- **Completed Courses:**
  - In this section, you'll find comprehensive notes for subjects and courses that I've successfully completed and handwriting notes.
    These notes are more detailed and structured, offering insights and knowledge acquired during the courses.
    They are ready for reference and can be valuable for those interested in specific subjects.
  
- **Past Subjects for Review:**
  - Sometimes, I like to revisit and review subjects I've learned in the past to refresh my knowledge.
    The notes in this section serve as a refresher for both myself and others.
    They contain insights and key takeaways from subjects I've previously studied.

- **Personal Experiences:**
  - This section contains notes on my personal experiences, thoughts, and insights.
    It's a glimpse into my life and the lessons I've learned along the way.
    These notes are more informal and can provide personal perspectives and life lessons.

## RECOMMEND
